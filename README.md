uCore+
==========

[![Travis CI status](https://travis-ci.org/oscourse-tsinghua/ucore_plus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oscourse-tsinghua/ucore_plus?branch=master)

You have found uCore+, a highly experimental operating system intended for Operating System Course in Tsinghua University.

## Compile & Run

### System requirements
uCore+ supports a lot of different architectures, including x86, amd64, ARM and MIPS.

Compiling uCore+ requires you having a (cross) compiler  installed for the a specific architecture. For most  linux distributions, **multilib gcc** (supporting x86 and amd64), and **arm-none-eabi-gcc** have builtin packages. You may need to compile a **mips-sde-elf-gcc** yourself. It is suggested to use the exact architecture tuple recommanded here.

There are some other packages you need to install (below is there package name in Ubuntu):

* **ncurses-dev** : used to build uCore+ build configuration tools.
* **qemu** : Provide the virtualized environment to run uCore+. Note that to use QEMU binaries for ARM and MIPS, extra packages needs to be installed manually for some linux distributions.
* **u-boot-tools** : providing the **mkimage** command, used to create u-boot image for ARM uCore+.

### Quick Try
Run the following commands in your terminal to get uCore+ AMD64 running on QEMU.

 1. download or clone uCore+ source code
 1. cd ucore
 1. make ARCH=amd64 defconfig
 1. make
 1. make sfsimg
 1. ./uCore_run

### Build with buildroot image
With the "Quick Try" part, you can get uCore run on QEMU. You will notice that when
running in this way, uCore only comes with a very limited number of program, and their features
are quiet limited.

However, uCore do have a compatible layer for
** Linux system calls **, making it possible to
run native Linux applications on uCore (https://travis-ci.org/oscourse-tsinghua/ucore_plus?branch=master)

## Support detail for architectures and features

### Architectures

#### i386

#### AMD64

#### ARM

** WARNING! Running uCore+ on any ARM hardwares may void your warranty. We are not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, and any kind of problems in your device. **

 * Goldfish

 * Raspberry Pi

 * Zedboard

 To run uCore on Zedboard, you need to build u-boot and have a device tree file. We can extract those files from Arch Linux ARM for Zedboard:

 `wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-zedboard-latest.tar.gz`

 Then follow the instructions on https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/xilinx/zedboard to setup Arch Linux ARM for zedboard on a SD Card. You can skip the part of actually install Arch Linux, configuring the boot partition is enough.

 To build uCore+ for Zedboard, run the following commands:

  1. cd ucore
  1. make ARCH=arm BOARD=zedboard defconfig
  1. make sfsimg
  1. make

 The following devices is supported by uCore+ for Zedboard:

  * GPIO
  * Serial port
  * Programmable Logic

    The driver is ported from u-boot source code,
    The driver create 2 char device files:
    * `/dev/zynq_programmable_logic`
    * `/dev/zynq_programmable_logic_ctl`

    Writing to `/dev/zynq_programmable_logic` updates a kernel space buffer for the contents to be transported to ZynqPL. Those content is not transported to the ZynqPL controller, until a 0x00 or 0x01 is written to `/dev/zynq_programmable_logic_ctl`.

    Writing 0x00 to `/dev/zynq_programmable_logic_ctl` means that you a transporting a full bit stream, and 0x01 stands for partial bitstream. Writing 0xFF clears the kernel space buffer.

    The current implementation uses DMA and interrupt. But it's still very inefficient.

    **TODO**: Implement mmap for kernel device file, or (better) implement sendfile / splice system call.

  * UIO Support
    The UIO support is prepared for Custom Zynq AXI PL Peripherals.
    Implementing a different device for every custom AXI PL Peripheral doesn't seems a good idea, because it leads to frequent change to kernel, yet these devices may have very simple interface. A UIO Device exposes a range of protected memory to user space, allowing the codes for the driver to be implemented in user space.

    **TODO**: Implement mmap for kernel device file.

    **TODO**:  In standard UIO device, MMIO and DMA uses mmap system call. read system call is used for interrupt handling.

#### MIPS

## Current Progress
 We are working on ucore plus for amd64 smp porting.
 You can chekout the "amd64-smp" branch to see the newest progress of ucore plus.

## Compile & Run on ARM
 Refer to `README_ZED.md`.


## Makefile
**Cross Compile**

set the environment variables:

export ARCH = ?

you can use archs: i386, arm, amd64, mips, or32, um, nios2

export CROSS\_COMPILE = ?

(see Makefile in ./ucore)

**Kconfig**

The top level Kconfig is ./ucore/arch/xxx/Kconfig. You can include other Kconfig

  (see ./ucore/arch/arm/Kconfig)

  All config option is prefixed with UCONFIG_

**Makefile**

Supported variables:  obj-y, dirs-y

(See ./ucore/kern-ucore/Makefile.build and Makefile.subdir)

**Add a new ARCH**

In arch/xxx, add Makefile.image and include.mk

***include.mk: define ARCH_INCLUDES and ARCH_CFLAGD, etc.

***Makefile.image: how to generate the executable for your platform.

***Kconfig: your top level Kconfig

***Makefile: recursively add Makefile in your arch directory.
